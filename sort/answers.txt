sort1 uses: BUBBLE SORT

How do you know?: Not efficient for high volumes of random and reversed dataset. However, good result for high volume sorted data set because
Bubble Sort will only have to pass through the dataset once.

sort2 uses: MERGE SORT

How do you know?: Most efficient in all the cases. Probably used recursively.

sort3 uses: SELECTION SORT

How do you know?: Runtime increases exponentially as the volume increases. Even if the dataset is already sorted, it needs to scan all the
data set n times.
